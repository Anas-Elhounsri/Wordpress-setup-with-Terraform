# Wordpress-setup-with-Terraform
In this code we automate setting up a wordpress on an EC2 instance along with the following services: EC2, VPC, S3, LB, VPN, EIP, Route53, and RDS.
I struggled using user data to automate installing wordpress with nginx and Postgre, so I decided to install it manually when connecting to the EC2 with the session manager, but I even sturggled more sadly but for the rest of the services its all coming along nicely.
